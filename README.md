# RME package

This package provides a algebraic normal form of boolean formulas
that are well suited for checking properties on xor-heavy boolean logic.

The `rme` library provides the underlying boolean function representation
and common bit-vector operations on booleans.

The `rme-what4` library provides an adapter for integrating the RME
representation as a solver for what4 assertions.
